This is a special issue of my zine run of *City That Reads: Baltimore Signs and Markings*.  This is a tex file I created with code in my https://github.com/patrickswickard/latex_photo_album_layout repository.

Most of the 220 photos in that album document the boardwalk in Ocean City, MD.  The boardwalk is lined with benches which have small memorial plaques on them which at some point could be purchased as a fundraiser with custom text.  Most of the text on the benches are memorials to loved ones who have passed away.  Some benches face the ocean, some face the boardwalk.  I was fascinated by the contrast between the fun and occasionally tacky boardwalk on one side, the peaceful beach and ocean on the other side, and a line of benches between them which mostly memorialize the dead.

On a similar note, one of my regular bar hangouts in Baltimore, the Mount Royal Tavern, does something similar on their bar.  They have a lot of small brass memorial plaques embedded in the bar surface with various messages on them--some are memorials to the dead, some are simply humorous and profane.  These were legible at one time but most have now been rubbed away by time, spilled beverages, and Bar Keepers Friend.  Here today, gone tomorrow.
